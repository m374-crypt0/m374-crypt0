# Senior Blockchain Protocol Engineer EVM / Yul / ZK(noir)

> Security • Performance • Production-grade protocols

I help teams secure, optimize, and scale EVM-based blockchain protocols. 15+
years in software engineering (C++/systems), now specialized in low-level smart
contracts (Solidity / Yul) and Zero-Knowledge systems (Noir / Barretenberg).

I work only on well-defined, contract-backed missions. No unpaid tests.

## What I Do (and Do Well)

- Protocol design & refactors (EVM)
- Smart contract security hardening (pre‑mainnet & post‑incident)
- Gas & performance optimization (Yul, EVM internals)
- Zero‑Knowledge integration (Noir / privacy-preserving flows)
- Critical off‑chain paths (indexing, services, infra)

> If your protocol already has users — or money at risk — you’re my target
> client.

## Specialization

### Core

- Solidity (advanced), Yul, EVM internals
- Foundry / Hardhat, invariant & fuzz testing
- Smart contract security patterns

### Deep Tech

- Zero‑Knowledge proofs
- Noir / Barretenberg
- Privacy & verifiable computation

### Infra (secondary)

- Nodes, indexers, off‑chain services
- Cloud & self‑hosted deployments

## Selected Work (Public)

> Short, concrete, verifiable. Each repo answers: problem → approach → result.

### 🔐 EVM Gas & Security Hardening

- **Problem**: High gas usage and unsafe edge cases in a production contract
- **Approach**: Yul refactor, storage layout optimization, invariant testing
- **Result**: ~35% gas reduction, critical paths hardened
- **Repo**: [dexterity](https://github.com/m374-crypt0/dexterity),
  [nifty](https://github.com/m374-crypt0/nifty)

### 🧩 ZK Privacy Module (Noir)

**Problem**: Add privacy guarantees without sacrificing UX
**Approach**: Noir circuits + verifier integration
**Result**: End‑to‑end private flow validated on testnet
**Repo**: [prize](https://github.com/m374-crypt0/prize)

### 🧪 Protocol Refactor v1 → v2

- **Problem**: Legacy design blocking scalability
- **Approach**: Modular architecture, upgrade-safe patterns
- **Result**: Cleaner audits, safer upgrades
- **Repo**: [dexterity](https://github.com/m374-crypt0/dexterity),
  [nifty](https://github.com/m374-crypt0/nifty),
  [prize](https://github.com/m374-crypt0/prize)

### ❔ Why these repositories exist

- [dexterity](https://github.com/m374-crypt0/dexterity) is not a product. It is
  a demonstration of architecture, security and invariant.
- [nifty](https://github.com/m374-crypt0/nifty) is not a "mint". It is a
  demonstration of patterns for safe-upgrade ability and governance-ready protocol.

## 🤔 How I Work

- Clear scope & milestones
- Contract before any technical work
- Async‑friendly, remote‑first
- Documentation & communication > hero coding

## Engagements

### Best fit

- Protocols in production or near mainnet
- Scale‑ups & Web2 companies entering Web3
- Security reviews, refactors, ZK integrations

### Not a fit

- Token launches & hype projects
- Unfunded MVPs
- DAOs without legal entity
